# Arduino ESP8266/ESP32 Exception Stack Trace Decoder [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/me-no-dev/EspExceptionDecoder.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/me-no-dev/EspExceptionDecoder)

Arduino plugin which lets you get a more meaningful explanation of the stack traces you get on ESP8266/ESP32.


## Installation
- Make sure you use one of the supported versions of Arduino IDE and have ESP8266/ESP32 core installed.
- Download the tool archive from [releases page](https://github.com/me-no-dev/EspExceptionDecoder/releases/latest).
- In your Arduino sketchbook directory, create tools directory if it doesn't exist yet.
- Unpack the tool into tools directory (the path will look like `<home_dir>/Arduino/tools/EspExceptionDecoder/tool/EspExceptionDecoder.jar)`.
- On newer versions of linux (Ubuntu 20.04), you may need to install the libncurses5 and libpython2.7 packages: `sudo apt install libncurses5 libpython2.7`
- Restart Arduino IDE.

## Usage
- Open a sketch and build it.
- Upload the sketch and monitor the Serial port for Exceptions
- When you get an Exception, open *Tools > ESP Exception Decoder* menu item. This will open a new window.
- Paste the stack trace into the window's top pane and the result will show in the bottom.
- Every time you enter new address or stack trace, the results will refresh

## Command line version
If you are searching for a command line version, look at [EspStackTraceDecoder](https://github.com/littleyoda/EspStackTraceDecoder). EspStackTraceDecoder is based on the EspExceptionDecoder, but was completely rewritten for the command line usage.
